# To Do App

This is a simple todo-app created with create-react-app. It stores the todos in the state as an array, meaning that everytime the browser is reloaded, the todos dissapears. It was created during my bootcamp at salt as an assignment. It was actually my very first app created with react.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
It will open the app on localhost:3000

### `npm test`
To run a couple of small tests
